<h1>Crazy Golf Construction Set Help</h1>
Welcome to the Crazy Golf Construction Set. This is an editor that allows
designing additional courses for the Crazy Golf mobile phone game.
<p>You can create new courses, load and save a course. Courses have a file
extension of <tt>.crs</tt>. The game itself will load courses with two-digit
numeric names, starting with <tt>00</tt>, <tt>01</tt> and so on.
<p>One course has 18 holes, and you must define all holes for the game to
be completely runnable. Each hole must have at least one starting zone
(blue rectangle) and at least one ball hole. Each hole also has a "par",
this is the number of strokes a player should at most use to complete
the hole.
<p>The editor shows
<ul>
<li>the hole (top left),
<li>a zoomed area of the hole (next to it, right),
<li>a preview of the selected element (top right),
<li>an element modification panel (center right), and
<li>an element selector view.
</ul>
<p>Once a course is open in the editor you can select an element from the
selector at the bottom of the window. You can now place the element into
the selected hole. Select an element on the hole itself and then change the
attributes as required. An element may be flipped horizontally or vertically.
An element may have a mode (normal, up or down - the latter two define the
direction into which the golf ball will roll if it is on such an element).
An element may also have a vector component. The vector can be individually
flipped to account for the desired "3D" effect.
<p>To select one or more elements you can press the mouse on the hole view
and then drag it. If the selection area (white rectangle) is wide enough, the
zoom window area will be defined (red rectangle).<br>
Selected elements can be moved one pixel by pressing the cursor keys.
<p>The element modification panel also allows to align elements. If a single
element is selected, the positioning is absolute (e.g. top moves to the top
of the screen, bottom to the bottom). If more than one element is selected,
the positioning occurs relative to the first selected element. This is useful
for e.g. positioning a hole directly in the middle of a pool.<br>
An element can also be brought to the front or sent to the back. If it is at
the back, all other elements are painted on top of it. For a selected element
there is a keyboard shortcut (<tt>Pos1</tt> - to front, <tt>End</tt> - to back)
<p>Happy designing and please contribute your courses so that the game can
be enhanced; send your courses to jan@engehausen.de
