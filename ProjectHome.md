This is a Java-based crazy golf game (also called "mini golf" where I come from) for mobile devices with a touch screen supporting CLDC-1.1 and MIDP 2.0 with a HVGA screen resolution (320x480). The game is currently in beta.

Here are some screenshots of the game:

The game currently offers one 18-hole golf course called "fannies world".<br>
<br>
The game also comes with an editor that allows you to design your own golf courses on your PC. Here's a screenshot of that (<a href='http://crazygolf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CrazyGolfGame/gfxtemplates/construction_set.png'>click here</a> for a larger version):<br>

Unfortunately while developing I used almost exclusively the phone emulator (Sun WTK 2.5.2), where the game runs fine. It turns out that the game runs a little too slow on my chinese mobile phone, maybe because of lacking performance or a slow Java implementation.<br>
<br>
I am interested in hearing how the game works for you and what device you are running it on. If you are a J2ME expert please feel free to look at the code for ways of improving the frame rate.<br>

Enjoy the beta...
